# Multidimensional Arrays in C

This program was written while learning the C programming language.

## Description
- Takes row and column input from the user
- Creates a 2D (multidimensional) array
- Fills the array with user input
- Prints the array
- Calculates the sum of each column
- Sorts each row from smallest to largest using functions

## Concepts Used
- Multidimensional arrays
- Functions
- Passing arrays to functions
- Nested loops
- Row-wise sorting algorithm

## Learning Outcome
I've used multidimensional arrays, functions, and sorting algorithms.
